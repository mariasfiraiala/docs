## Cross-compiling `AArch64` apps

The toolchain that should be used for `AArch64` is `aarch64-none-elf`, to be installed from [the official Arm development site](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.2-2022.02/binrel/gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz?rev=981d8f7e91864070a466d852589598e2&hash=8D5397D4E41C99A96989ED813E8E95F0).

Similar with the command we'll present for cross-compiling with `clang`, we build the app using

```console
$ make -j $(nproc) CROSS_COMPILE=~/toolchains/gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf/bin/aarch64-none-elf-
```

## Cross-compiling Unikraft with `Clang`

As `clang` becomes more and more used in the industry, we also provide a series of steps in order to compile your application with it.
Besides coming up with cool sanitizers (SafeStack, ShadowStack and more), `clang` becomes a very interesting alternative to `gcc` when it comes to speed and memory[^1], so why not give it a try?!

Firstly, we must consider what architecture we are working on, because the steps differ quite a bit.

### `Clang` on `x86`

Configure your application as you would usually do, then build it using:

```console
$ make CC=clang
```

### `Clang` on `AArch64`

There are two ways of cross-compiling your app based off the toolchain you'll choose;
there's either `aarch64-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-none-linux-gnu`.
The first one can be installed via your default package manager (the `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` package on Ubuntu), while the second one should be fetched from the [official Arm development site](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.2-2022.02/binrel/gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu.tar.xz?rev=33c6e30e5ac64e6dba8f0431f2c35f1b&hash=AE0C3F32FC140B87A05846EBF9494722).

To configure your app keep your regular configuartions and dissable all the `erratums` from the `Architecture Selection`.

* If you choose to use `aarch64-linux-gnu`, build your application with:

```console
$ make -j $(ncpus) CC=clang
```

* If you choose to use `aarch64-none-linux-gnu`, build your application with:

```console
$ make -j $(ncpus) CROSS_COMPILE=~/toolchains/gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-none-linux-gnu- CC=clang
```

<Warning>
The actual right way of building apps on `AArch64` is by cross-compiling with `aarch64-none-elf`, as the other toolchains expect `glibc` to be used, while that's not the case for unikraft.

However, `aarch64-none-elf` clashes with our expectations regarding the `emutls` and becomes unusable together with `clang`.
